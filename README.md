## Elden Ring Seamless Co-op Updater

I have created a simple program to help with updating the [Seamless Co-op](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510) 
mod for Elden Ring, by using the latest release from the [github mirror](https://github.com/LukeYui/EldenRingSeamlessCoopRelease/releases)

One can typically just update it by hand, but I made this simple program just to help my own lazy ass.
